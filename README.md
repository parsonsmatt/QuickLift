# QuickLift

QuickLift: because everyone should have a fast and easy way to log their sessions.

## About

QuickLift is built on the [scotty](https://github.com/scotty-web/scotty) Haskell web framework. Here's a quick description of the upcoming features:

* user authentication!
* Storing text of weightlifting sessions
* Parsing that text into machine readable format
* Perform analytics on that information
* Storing future sessions
* Planning future sessions via workout programs

The UI of QuickLift will be fast, easy, intuitive, and non-intrusive. The logging application will be very lightweight, working just as well on mobile as desktop clients.
